# Ghidra scripts

Ghidra scripts I wrote while dealing with some shady business.

- [DumpFunctionOffsets.java](DumpFunctionOffsets.java): Dump all function names
    and offsets for tracing.
- [GenerateReferenceGraph.java](GenerateReferenceGraph.java): Generate a
    reference graph of functions and data (wip).
- [ListNoreturnFunctions.java](ListNoreturnFunctions.java): Good to know the
    reason why half of the functions are half-disassembled because of one dumb
    noreturn attribute.
